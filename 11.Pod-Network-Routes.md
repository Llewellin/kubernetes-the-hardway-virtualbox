# Provisioning Pod Network Routes

Pods scheduled to a node receive an IP address from the node's Pod CIDR range. At this point pods can not communicate with other pods running on different nodes due to missing routes which is responsible to do NAT 

In this lab you will create a route for each worker node that routes Pod IP to 192.168.78.0/24 network .

> There are [other ways](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#how-to-achieve-this) to implement the Kubernetes networking model.

## The Routing Table

In this section you will gather the information required to create routes in the worker nodes.

IP address and Pod CIDR range for each worker instance:

```
+------------+------------------+----------------+
| Worker     | IP Address       | Pod CIDR       |
+------------+------------------+----------------+
| worker-01  | 192.168.78.211   | 10.10.1.0/24   |
| worker-02  | 192.168.78.212   | 10.10.2.0/24   |
| worker-03  | 192.168.78.213   | 10.10.3.0/24   |
+------------+------------------+----------------+

```


## Routes

Create network routes for each worker instance:

```
ROUTE_DATA="worker-01,192.168.78.211,10.10.1.0/24
worker-02,192.168.78.212,10.10.2.0/24
worker-03,192.168.78.213,10.10.3.0/24"

for instance in worker-01 worker-02 worker-03
do
 ROUTE_MINI=$(echo "${ROUTE_DATA}" | grep -v -w ${instance})
  for ROUTE in ${ROUTE_MINI}
  do 
   echo "#### Adding Route for ${instance} ####"
   NET=$(echo ${ROUTE} |awk -F "," '{print $3}')
   GW=$(echo ${ROUTE} |awk -F "," '{print $2}')
   ssh -t k8s@${instance} sudo -i "echo -e \"\tpost-up route add -net ${NET} gw ${GW}\"|sudo tee --append  /etc/network/interfaces"
   ssh -t k8s@${instance} sudo -i "route add -net ${NET} gw ${GW}"
  done
done

```
List all routes 

```
for instance in worker-01 worker-02 worker-03; do  ssh k8s@${instance} "ip route show|grep ^10.10"; done
```
- Output 
```
k8s@worker-01's password:
10.10.2.0/24 via 192.168.78.212 dev enp0s8
10.10.3.0/24 via 192.168.78.213 dev enp0s8
k8s@worker-02's password:
10.10.1.0/24 via 192.168.78.211 dev enp0s8
10.10.3.0/24 via 192.168.78.213 dev enp0s8
k8s@worker-03's password:
10.10.1.0/24 via 192.168.78.211 dev enp0s8
10.10.2.0/24 via 192.168.78.212 dev enp0s8
```
