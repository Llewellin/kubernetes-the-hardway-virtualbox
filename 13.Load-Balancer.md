# LoadBalancer 

[MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/) hooks into your Kubernetes cluster, and provides a network load-balancer implementation. 
In short, it allows you to create Kubernetes services of type “LoadBalancer” in clusters that don’t run on a cloud provider, and thus cannot simply hook into paid products to provide load-balancers.
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/metallb/v0.7.3/manifests/metallb.yaml
```

This will deploy MetalLB to your cluster, under the metallb-system namespace. The components in the manifest are:

- The `metallb-system/controller` deployment. This is the cluster-wide controller that handles IP address assignments.
- The `metallb-system/speaker` daemonset. This is the component that speaks the protocol(s) of your choice to make the services reachable.
- Service accounts for the controller and speaker, along with the RBAC permissions that the components need to function.

- Verify
```
kubectl get pods -n metallb-system -o wide
```
- Output 
```

```
The installation manifest does not include a configuration file. MetalLB’s components will still start, but will remain idle until you define and deploy a configmap.

Layer 2 mode is the simplest to configure: in many cases, you don’t need any protocol-specific configuration, only IP addresses.
For example, the following configuration gives MetalLB control over IPs from `192.168.78.50` to `192.168.78.150`, and configures Layer 2 mode:

Lets create a configmap yaml 
```
vi metallb-config.yaml
```
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: config
data:
  config: |
    address-pools:
    - name: default
      protocol: layer2
      addresses:
      - 192.168.78.50-192.168.78.150
```
Create config map
```
kubectl create -f metallb-config.yaml
```
